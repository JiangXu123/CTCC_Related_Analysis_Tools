# CTCC_Related_Analysis_Tools
In this repository, I will shared the tools I wrote for preparation of data for HiC analysis data visualization.
There are total of 5 category of tools. 
The first one contains the tool for sequencing data preparation, like trimming of reads in fastq file by the desired lenth, this will also trimmed the reads quality scores
accordingly.
The second one contains the tools for analyzing the breaking location of genomic DNA. In CTCC, we used Biotinized adaptors to label DNA breaking ends and help proximity ligation and 
ligation junction enrichment. The use of these adaptors helps tracking of the DNA generated by cryomilling. The algorithm used can also be used to track the breaking location 
of DNA by other methods such as sonication, which are widely used in ChIP-Seq and SPRITE.
The third one contains the tools for HiC pairs preparation, such as fitering of MPQ scores or trimming the reads to the desired ones, or subcompartment tagging for Hi pairs. 
The fourth one contains the tools for SPRITE Data analysis. SPRITE is a method developed by Quinodoz, S. A. et al(2018) for studying nuclear structure without proximity ligation.
The fivth one contains tools for extraction peak and valley postion from a bedgraph file, such tool is useful for get the position of interest(such as valley and peak) for pileup assay in HiC analysis.

## How to use them?
1. make sure you installed the correct python version, currently only support python 3.7
2. copy and paste each python code to your text editor such as nano, ctrl + x to save the code to the desired name, such as xxx.py
3. chmod +x xxx.py
4. make a customized folder you desired to store your own python code, such as my_own_python_code:   mkdir ~/my_own_python_code
5. move the python code you just created to this folder:  mv ./xxx.py ~/my_own_python_code
6. add the following line path to the .bash_profile in the home directory, you can use nano or vim text editor to open the bash_profile file
   export PATH=/Users/jiangxu/Documents/my_own_python_code:$PATH
